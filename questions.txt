1. In order to implement last play bot I created 3 new instance variables in the Player
   class: currentPlay, lastPlay and opponent. The opponent of each player is set after the two
   players are created. This allows LastPlayBot to access its opponent's lastPlay variable which is
   updated by calling the update method of the Player after both players play. The update method sets
   lastPlay to currentPlay which is set when the Player plays. If lastPlay is null, then LastPlayBot
   plays a random move by creating a RandomBot.

2. I created MyBot based on a couple of articles I read about how rock paper scissors players are likely
   to play the same move multiple times if they win with it. In order to counter this behavior, MyBot
   looks at its opponent's last move and randomly plays one of the two moves that beats that move. If
   lastPlay is null then it plays a random move.

4. I like the interaction between two LastPlayBots and how they just switch back and forth between two moves.
   The only Players that StupidBot can beat is RandomBot and HumanPlayer if they play really poorly.
   MyBot seems to be a good match against every bot except for IterativeBot since it never plays the same move twice.
   As a Human Play I can consistently beat all of the bots except for RandomBot and MyBot.

7. The thing I dislike most about Java is that it feels very repetitive with things like type declarations and
   creating getters and setters.

8. I liked the lab. I enjoyed the idea of it and it was fun to play with at the end. I didn't like the repetition
   required to create the elements and players and writing out all of the possible outcomes.

10. I've had a lot of experience with Java from CSCI 112, 132, 232 and machine learning.
